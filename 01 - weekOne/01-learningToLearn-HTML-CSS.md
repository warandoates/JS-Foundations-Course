### Unit 1: Learning to Learn

Being a student in this program is like drinking from a firehose. It's going to feel like information is just gushing out of your instructors on a daily basis with no way to control the flow.
Since you probably haven't been a student in a while, this article will help prepare you on how to be a sponge and retain as much of that information as possible.

The objectives of this unit are to:

- Describe why becoming a better learner is important.
- Explain how to become a better learner using a three step process.
- Identify a few personal strengths regarding this process.
- Identify at least one personal weakness regarding this process.
